## Abstract

Light field microscopy (LFM) has been widely used for recording 3D biological dynamics at camera frame rate. However, LFM suffers from artifact contaminations due to the illness of the reconstruction problem via naive Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. Moreover, the performance of LFM significantly dropped in low-light conditions due to the absence of sample priors. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze different kinds of artifacts and present a new LFM technique termed dictionary LFM (DiLFM) that substantially suppresses various kinds of reconstruction artifacts and improves the noise robustness with an over-complete dictionary. We demonstrate artifact-suppressed reconstructions in scattering samples such as Drosophila embryos and brains. Furthermore, we show our DiLFM can achieve robust blood cell counting in noisy conditions by imaging blood cell dynamic at 100 Hz and unveil more neurons in whole-brain calcium recording of zebrafish with low illumination power in vivo.
