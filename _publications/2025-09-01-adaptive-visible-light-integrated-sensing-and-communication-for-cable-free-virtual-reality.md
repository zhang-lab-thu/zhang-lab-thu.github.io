## Abstract

Visible light communication plays an essential role in the next-generation 6G network due to its extremely high bandwidth and ultrafast transmission speed. Incorporating position sensing functionality into the communication system is highly desired for achieving target-oriented beamforming and accommodating high-speed data service. However, an efficient solution to integrated sensing and light communication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an integrated system that concurrently accomplishes high-precision sensing and high-speed data transmission by spatio-temporal modulation of the illumination and computational reconstruction. We developed a compressive angular projection imaging scheme to achieve rapid three-dimensional localization with high resolution, and a jointly optimized waveform design ensures slight sacrifice in the transmission data rate on the integrated system. We experimentally demonstrated a resolving resolution of 1&#x00A0;mm in lateral and 4&#x00A0;cm in depth within 0.6&#x2009;&#x2009;m&#x00D7;0.6&#x2009;&#x2009;m&#x00D7;0.6&#x2009;&#x2009;m volume over 2&#x00A0;m distance at the sensing speed of 39&#x00A0;Hz in both static and dynamic conditions. This capability enables adaptive beamforming, which significantly enhances the data rate by 184% to permit errorless transmission of high-throughput virtual reality videos. Our work offers a promising route for intelligent wireless light communication systems with spatial perception capability, presenting the possibility of cable-free, immersive virtual reality experiences.
