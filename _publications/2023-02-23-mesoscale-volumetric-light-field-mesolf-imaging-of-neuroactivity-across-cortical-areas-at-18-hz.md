## Abstract

Various implementations of mesoscopes provide optical access for calcium imaging across multi-millimeter fields of view in the mammalian brain; however, capturing the activity of the neuronal population within such fields of view near-simultaneously and in a volumetric fashion has remained challenging as approaches for imaging scattering brain tissues typically are based on sequential acquisition. Here we present a modular, mesoscale light-field (MesoLF) imaging hardware and software solution that allows recording from thousands of neurons within volumes of ⌀ 4 x 0.2 mm, located at up to 350 microm depth in the mouse cortex, at 18 volumes per second and an effective voxel rate of ~40 megavoxels per second. Using our optical design and computational approach we show recording of ~10,000 neurons across multiple cortical areas in mice using workstation-grade computing resources.
