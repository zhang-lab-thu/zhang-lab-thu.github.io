## Abstract

We demonstrate a single-pixel imaging (SPI) method that can achieve pixel resolution beyond the physical limitation of the spatial light modulator (SLM), by adopting sinusoidal amplitude modulation and frequency filtering. Through light field analysis, we observe that the induced intensity with a squared value of the amplitude contains higher frequency components. By filtering out the zero frequency of the sinusoidal amplitude in the Fourier domain, we can separate out the higher frequency components, which enables SPI with higher resolving ability and thus beyond the limitation of the SLM. Further, to address the speed issue in grayscale spatial light modulation, we propose a fast implementation scheme with tens-of-kilohertz refresh rate. Specifically, we use a digital micromirror device (DMD) working at the full frame rate to conduct binarized sinusoidal patterning in the spatial domain and pinhole filtering eliminating the binarization error in the Fourier domain. For experimental validation, we build a single-pixel microscope to retrieve 1200 x 1200-pixel images via a sub-megapixel DMD, and the setup achieves comparable performance to array sensor microscopy and provides additional sectioning ability.
