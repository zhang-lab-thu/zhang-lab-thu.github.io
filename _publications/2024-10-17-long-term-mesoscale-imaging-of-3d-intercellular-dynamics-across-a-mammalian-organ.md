## Abstract

<h2>Summary</h2><p>A comprehensive understanding of physio-pathological processes necessitates non-invasive intravital three-dimensional (3D) imaging over varying spatial and temporal scales. However, huge data throughput, optical heterogeneity, surface irregularity, and phototoxicity pose great challenges, leading to an inevitable trade-off between volume size, resolution, speed, sample health, and system complexity. Here, we introduce a compact real-time, ultra-large-scale, high-resolution 3D mesoscope (RUSH3D), achieving uniform resolutions of 2.6 × 2.6 × 6 μm<sup>3</sup> across a volume of 8,000 × 6,000 × 400 μm<sup>3</sup> at 20 Hz with low phototoxicity. Through the integration of multiple computational imaging techniques, RUSH3D facilitates a 13-fold improvement in data throughput and an orders-of-magnitude reduction in system size and cost. With these advantages, we observed premovement neural activity and cross-day visual representational drift across the mouse cortex, the formation and progression of multiple germinal centers in mouse inguinal lymph nodes, and heterogeneous immune responses following traumatic brain injury—all at single-cell resolution, opening up a horizon for intravital mesoscale study of large-scale intercellular interactions at the organ level.</p>
