## Abstract

Compressive sensing technique allows capturing fast phenomena at much higher frame rate than the camera sensor, by recovering a frame sequence from their encoded combination. However, most conventional compressive video sensing methods limit the achieved frame rate improvement to tenfold and only support low resolution recovery. Making use of camera's redundant spatial resolution for further frame rate improve, here we report a novel compressive video acquisition technique termed Sinusoidal Sampling Enhanced Compressive Camera (S2EC2) to encode denser frames within a snapshot. Specifically, we decompose the dense frames into groups and apply combinational coding: random codes within each group for compressive acquisition; group specific sinusoidal codes to multiplex different groups onto the high resolution sensor. The sinusoidal codes designed for these groups would shift their frequency components by different offsets in the Fourier domain and staggered the dominant frequencies of the coded measurements of these groups. Correspondingly, the reconstruction successfully separate coded measurements of different groups and recovers frames within each group. Besides, we also solve the implementation problem of insufficient gray scale spatial light modulation speed, and build a prototype achieving 2000 fps reconstruction with a 15.6 fps camera (the actual compression ratio is 0.009). The extensive experiments validate the proposed approach.
