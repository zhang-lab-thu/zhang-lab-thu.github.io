## Positions

The Yuanlong Zhang Lab at Tsinghua University develops experimental and computational methods for large-scale brain observation, language-compatible descriptions of behavior, and NeuroAI. We welcome applications from curious, self-driven people who enjoy building tools, working with complex data, and turning ideas into testable results.

We currently recruit at the following levels:

### Postdoctoral positions

We are always interested in applications from highly motivated postdoctoral candidates who want to work on optical/electronic neurotechnology development, quantitative behavior analysis, and/or computational neuroscience and machine learning. Strong fits include backgrounds in neuroengineering, systems neuroscience, optics/imaging, signal processing, statistics, or ML for neuroscience. If you are interested in joining, please email **[yuanlongzhang]@[tsinghua.edu.cn]** with your application materials: **CV**, a **brief research statement** (what you’ve done + what you want to do), and **2–3 representative papers/preprints** (or a link). Please also include **contact information for 2–3 references**.

### PhD positions

We welcome PhD applicants with backgrounds in engineering, physics, mathematics, computer science, neuroscience, or related fields. PhD applicants must be admitted through the appropriate Tsinghua University graduate program to officially join. If you are considering applying, please email **[yuanlongzhang]@[tsinghua.edu.cn]** with your **CV**, a short description of your **research interests**, any **publications/preprints** (if available), and **contact information for two references**.

### Research intern positions (engineering / mathematics / computer science)

We welcome research interns with strong quantitative backgrounds (engineering, mathematics, computer science, or related disciplines). Intern projects may include instrument prototyping, data engineering, simulation, ML model development, or analysis pipelines for neural/behavioral data. Please email **[yuanlongzhang]@[tsinghua.edu.cn]** with your **CV**, a short note on your **skills and interests**, and your **availability** (start/end dates, expected weekly time commitment). Including a link to a **GitHub/portfolio** is encouraged.

### Research technician (animal surgery and experimental support)

We are recruiting a research technician to support animal experiments, with an emphasis on rodent surgical procedures and post-operative care. Responsibilities may include assisting with (and, after training, performing) surgeries, animal handling, health monitoring, record keeping, coordination of supplies, and maintaining high standards of experimental quality and compliance with institutional regulations. Applicants should be meticulous, reliable, comfortable working in an animal facility, and able to document work clearly. Prior experience with rodent handling/surgery is a strong plus; strong motivation to learn and follow protocols is essential. Please email **[yuanlongzhang]@[tsinghua.edu.cn]** with your **CV**, a brief summary of **relevant experience**, and **contact information for 1–2 references**.

### Visiting scholars

We welcome visiting scholars for focused collaborative projects. Please contact **[yuanlongzhang]@[tsinghua.edu.cn]** with your **research interests**, a **proposed collaboration plan**, your **CV/publication list**, and your **preferred visiting period**.
