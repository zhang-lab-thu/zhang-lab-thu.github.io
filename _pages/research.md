## Research Overview

Our lab focuses on cutting-edge research in [your research field]. We employ interdisciplinary approaches combining [methods/techniques] to address fundamental questions in [research area].

## Research Areas

### Area 1: Pan-scale brain observation
We have dedicated to develop mesoscale and pan-scale brain observation tools, leveraging cutting edge technology.
Effort including


**Key Projects:**
- Project 1: 3D mesoscopic brain observatrion (Nature Methods 2023 Mesoscope light field microscope,Cell 2024 Mesoscope light field microscope)
- Project 2: 

-- Freely behaving observations. Systematically Optimized Miniaturized Mesoscope (SOMM) based on a principled optimization strategy that incorporates diffractive optical elements. SOMM facilitates the recording of cellular population activity at rates up to 16 Hz within a 3.6 × 3.6 mm² FOV in the cortex of freely moving mice. This is achieved while maintaining a 4 µm resolution and a 300 µm depth-of-field, all at a weight of less than 2.5 grams (Nature Biomedical Engineering 2024)
-- I have developed an end-to-end machine learning framework specifically designed for extended depth-of-field miniaturized microscopy. The resulting integrated microscope surpasses the optical performance of commercial microscopes equipped with a 5×, NA 0.1 objective, yet occupies a volume of only 0.15 cm³ and weighs a mere 0.5 grams—dimensions that are five orders of magnitude smaller than those of conventional microscopes 

### Area 2: Large-scale neuronal processing
We developing neuronal processing tools.
